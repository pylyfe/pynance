    "# Charity Through Marginal Price Discrimination\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we are going to explore and break down a very interesting post by Vitalik Buterin on his website:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://vitalik.ca/jekyll/general/2017/03/11/a_note_on_charity.html\n",
    "\n",
    "He believes that using marginal price discrimination, people can be incentivized (through social and economic pressures) to participate towards a certain cause. This is facilitated quite easily through the use of blockchain technology, where we can build an ecosystem of \"stickers\" (non-transferable digital tokens that organizations hand out to people who they think are contributing towards a worthy cause). \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, being or working for a merchant that offers lower prices to sticker holders is enough to merit you one of these stickers. Buterin believes that by doing this it will make the scheme recursive. If an entire community approves of a particular cause, it will be profit-maximizing to start offering discounts for the associated sticker, causing everyone to maintain stable equilibrium in the level of spending and participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore further, click on the link above on how Vitalik Buterin plans to implement this scheme. However, he also provides a Python script that shows an economic simulation described in the post, and we will break it down here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buterin uses the example of sandwich buyers and sellers in the economic simulation. First assumption is that the cost of producing a sandwich is $6."
